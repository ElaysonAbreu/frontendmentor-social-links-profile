## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile and desktop workflow

### What I learned

It is possible to give hoverability to `<button>` using the `:hover` pseudo-class, for example:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
  color: green;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about other values ​​for `display` property, especially CSS Flexboxes.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_buttons.asp) - It was essential to understand how `<button>` works.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css_align.asp) - Foi difícil centralizar `<body>` horizontal e verticalmente simultaneamente.
